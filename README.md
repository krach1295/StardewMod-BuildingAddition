# StardewMod-BuildingAddition
The goal is to make additions onto the game Stardew Valley. 
In the end, I would like the additions to be two new characters and a house for them to live in, 
as well as interactions and schedules for them. 
Stretch goals would include the ability to buy things from one of them like a shop.

This is the code to add the a new building to the main town map.
